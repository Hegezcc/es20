Tension, nerve kitzel, an ultimate outdoor experience at dizzy heights awaits you in our high-ropes skyloft. Five courses with different levels of difficulty ensure the right kick. At a height between 8 and 15 meters you move from tree crown to tree crown, from one platform to the next. They balance beams, tree trunks, ropes and overcome swinging rope constructions. They mobilize unimaginable forces. Experience the world from the bird's eye view. Discover yourself and rely on your team. Skyloft is pure adventure.
